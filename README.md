## Idea

Habits are very neccessary building blocks of long term self improvement as making small changes to you day to day life can lead to compounded results in the long run. We made OneStep, a platform that allows user to embark on the journey of self improvement by building habits.

Main emphasis of this app is on building and tracking daily goals, rather than long term goals. Here are the three main feautres that we implemented:

1. Daily Journal
2. Habit Tracker
3. Todo Daily Planner

## Developement

This full stack application was made using React, Express and PostgreSQL. Make sure to have those installed properly on you local machine.
